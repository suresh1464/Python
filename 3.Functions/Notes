1. Functions in python are defined using the def keyword, followed by function name and parenthesis, which may include parameters
2. Parameters allow functions to receive inputs, making them flexible and reusable for different data inputs
3. The return statement is used to send function's result back to the caller, exiting the function and optionally passing back a value
