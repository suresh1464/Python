1. Tuples are immutable data structures in python, which means once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be added,changed or removed
2. Dictionary in python are mutable data structures that store key-value pairs allowing fast data retrival by key(hashmap)
3. Dictionary is a python specific implementation of a Hashmap data structure
4. Keys in dictionaries must be unique and immutable types, such as strings,numbers or tuples ensuring that each ket maps distinctly to its values.
5. Both Tuples and Dictionaries support various methods and operations such as accessing elements,iterating over them, etc for efficient data manipulation and retrieval
